= Experiment #1: StatsBot

This bot looks at the kingdom before starting the game and chooses the best bot from a list of scripted bots.

== Idea

Now that I have implemented all base game cards, mostly finished with Dominiate
port and implemented all DominionSim bots that only require base cards I have a
selection of 32 heavily scripted bots.

These bots have no real learning or decision-making so StatsBot will be the
first agent to make a decision. Before beginning the game it will look at the
kingdom and choose the best bot to play the game. It will then forward all
choices to the selected bot.

== Learning

Some reinforced learning can be added by updating the stats after every game.
Also different selection policies could be used as in a k-armed bandit
problem.
Some adjustment might be necessary as not every action (i.e. bot) is available
on each game, depending on kingdom selection.

=== Steps needed to Implement

* Create a bot with the ability to successfully forward all choices to another bot.
* Add a step at the beginning of the game to analyse the board and set AI parameters.
* Add the ability to store and load stats so bot can update its knowledge as it plays.
