= Experiment #1: StatsBot

This bot looks at the kingdom before starting the game and chooses the best bot from a list of scripted bots.

== Idea

Now that I have implemented all base game cards, mostly finished with Dominiate
port and implemented all DominionSim bots that only require base cards I have a
selection of 32 heavily scripted bots.

These bots have no real learning or decision-making so StatsBot will be the
first agent to make a decision. Before beginning the game it will look at the
kingdom and choose the best bot to play the game. It will then forward all
choices to the selected bot.

Some learning can be added by updating the stats after every game. Also the
selection policy could be altered to select a statistically suboptimal bot to
gain more confidence in the stats. Something like UCB footnote:[UCB (Upper confidence Bound) is an algorithm used in Multi-armed bandit problems to balance exploration and exploitation.] can be used for this
which, in my book at least, counts as learning.

=== Steps needed to Implement

* Create a bot with the ability to successfully forward all choices to another bot.
* Add a step at the beginning of the game to analyse the board and set AI parameters.
* Add the ability to store and load stats so bot can update its knowledge as it plays.
